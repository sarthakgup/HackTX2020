Project By: Sarthak Gupta
COVID-19 Resource Guide Web App

Overview: Once completed, the goal of this project is to act as a congregate of data, tips, and resources for
the public to use for their benefit. It will include links to helpful government information
websites and links to research papers as well as some guides/documents including instructions for 
interesting COVID-related projects such as 3D printing face masks.

The app is a living piece of code and will evolve as time goes on.

Thanks!
